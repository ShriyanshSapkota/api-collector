# api-collector

In this project, I wrote a python script to collect JSON data from an API.
This data was then shipped to kafka.
The data is collected from Kafka usinng Logstash and indexed into Elasticsearch so itt can be visualised on Kibana.

Due to the sensitive nature of this project, i have had to remove certainn lines of code and have not been able to upload all relevant data.
